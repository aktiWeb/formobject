### Goals ###

The main goals of formobject are:

* Being able to simply build a form from php
* At the place where you fill or read the form (normally your controller), you just do that
without thinking about the presentation of it, its validation or even if its valid
* Your form HTML Generation is splitted from you're page template (if you want)
* Change the forms to whatever css framework you like without needing to change your php code
* Allow easy inspection by javascript/css to customize the client part of your forms
* Easy Integration in any framework/application
